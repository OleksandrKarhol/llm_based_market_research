This team supports products that help the construction industry connect workflows, teams, and data across the entire project lifecycle √¢¬Ä¬î enhancing collaboration and efficiency. Used by leading construction firms worldwide, ACC enables teams to manage documents, track progress, control costs, and ensure quality. By integrating all aspects of construction management, the platform helps users deliver projects on time and within budget.Autodesk acquired BuildingConnected and PlanGrid in 2018 to augment their existing product capabilities. The BuildingConnected and PlanGrid support teams operated independently until they merged into the larger Autodesk support team. This team continued to assist the existing customer base and expanded to support the launch of the new ACC platform in early 2021. As the team grew to manage nearly a dozen product workflows under the ACC umbrella, it became clear that relying on spreadsheets for workforce management (WFM) was no longer feasible. A robust WFM solution was needed to keep pace with ACC's expanding operations.Finding a WFM built for the entire teamThe ACC support team√¢¬Ä¬ôs goal was to improve the customer experience by ensuring that staffing across its various products and various modes of communication (chat, email/web form, outbound phone) was as accurate as possible. An equally important sub-goal was finding a WFM that would provide a great experience for the agents who would use it daily. The team had grown to over 65 agents (and counting) and needed technology to support them while they continued to scale.Partnering with a vendor that would help us deliver a world-class experience for our customers was top priority. Since happy employees foster happy customers, we ultimately chose Assembled for its agent-centric user experience and ease of use. √Ç The Autodesk Construction Cloud support team especially liked that Assembled did not require a steep learning curve to navigate and that it was intuitive and √Ç empowering for both agents and managers to use.√¢¬Ä¬ùJessica Bright, Customer Support ManagerRight away, the team was able to save time they used to spend in spreadsheets and operate more efficiently. This allowed managers to focus on real-time performance monitoring and coaching with their agents.The ACC leadership team firmly believed that the path to improving the customer experience via Assembled would start with schedule adherence. Wanting nothing but the best for its customers, the ACC support team set an initial adherence KPI of 85% (5% higher than Assembled√¢¬Ä¬ôs guidance of 80% as the industry standard in SaaS) and eventually pushed it to 90%. Once they achieved this goal, the ACC team looked for opportunities to further optimize scheduling in Assembled.Co-building WFM to scale with Autodesk√¢¬Ä¬ôs evolving needsJust as the Autodesk Construction Cloud support team is a trusted partner to its customers, it is a trusted partner and beta tester for core platform improvements in Assembled. A great example of this is the ACC support team√¢¬Ä¬ôs role in shaping Assembled√¢¬Ä¬ôs seasonal forecasting model. Construction is a seasonal business, making the ACC support team an ideal first user. The team was open to beta testing and provided invaluable feedback that was instrumental in fine tuning the model √¢¬Ä¬î which is now widely used by many Assembled customers.This trusted partnership and willingness to co-build goes both ways. At the end of 2022, the ACC support team approached Assembled with a proposal to create specializations across its customer support organization.The team√¢¬Ä¬ôs initial setup, which involved cross-training agents on up to 11 different products, was causing challenges with staffing and productivity measurement. Each product had its own queue, and agents were counted as partial headcounts in multiple queues, requiring manual over-staffing. This complicated tracking and required extra work to manage forecasting√Ç accurately.To address the ACC support team√¢¬Ä¬ôs scheduling needs, Assembled got on a plane and met with the team onsite to map out a comprehensive specialization strategy. For the next two months, experts from Assembled√¢¬Ä¬ôs solutions team conducted bi-weekly sessions with the ACC support team to pressure-test the new setup until it met all requirements.Ultimately, this effort delivered better customer and employee experiences while unlocking more accurate forecasting for staffing requirements and deeper productivity metrics.By working with Assembled as our partner, we have built a system that can scale and adapt. The implementation of Assembled was one of the largest transformation programs in the history of our team and was also one of the most successful in all its phases from launch until now. We were managing scheduling manually in excel, and then we stepped into this innovation mode to improve the employee experience and, of course, the customer experience. Our support team, comprised of√Ç changemakers, pushed boundaries and exceeded industry standards. We partnered with the Assembled team as trusted partners, and it worked out amazingly well. Our shared vision for workforce management helped us achieve both our long-term and short-term goals. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm looking forward to seeing how AI will be infused into Assembled and how our team can leverage that.√¢¬Ä¬ùCaroline Moore, Senior Manager, Customer SupportMaximizing staffing resources to ensure customers can get help as quickly as possible is of utmost importance to the ACC team. As the team became more adept at using Assembled to adjust scheduling to drive more positive customer experiences, the team was able to reduce average chat wait time by 40%.Partnership over vendorshipThe collaboration between the Autodesk Construction Cloud support team and Assembled exemplifies the impact of partnership over vendorship. By actively engaging with the team as a true thought partner and co-builder, Assembled was able to understand the unique challenges the ACC support team faced and helped them achieve their goals. As a result, the ACC support team overcame staffing complexities, streamlined operations in a dynamic environment, and significantly enhanced both customer and employee experiences. The Autodesk Construction Cloud support team and Assembled are in a prime position to expand this partnership to other pillars throughout the global support organization.Looking ahead with Case LifecycleIn the spirit of partnership, the ACC support team volunteered to beta test Case Lifecycle √¢¬Ä¬î a new data model that breaks cases down into individual ""units of work,"" such as transfers, escalations, pauses, re-opens, and resolutions. With agents split into two tiers and a product suite with varying levels of complexity, the ACC support team is a perfect candidate for Case Lifecycle.Prior to Case Lifecycle, the team struggled to track precisely how many cases were being transferred from the tier 1 team to the tier 2 team and, in some instances, back to the tier 1 team for a follow-up with the customer. But now, the team can monitor the transfer rate for each representative, gaining insight into the workflow for these tickets. This data helps set benchmarks for improving the customer experience for transferred cases. With the ability to analyze the number of actions agents take to resolve issues at the product level, the team can better forecast across its product suite.With Assembled√¢¬Ä¬ôs Case Lifecycle data model, the ACC support team now has accurate volume metrics in Assembled. The alignment of data between Assembled and Salesforce allows the ACC support team to confidently move toward using Assembled as its single source of truth for reliable information.Looking ahead, the ACC support team is excited about the continued improvements and deeper insights that Case Lifecycle will bring. With Assembled as a steadfast partner, the team is well equipped to tackle future challenges and continue delivering exceptional support to Autodesk Construction Cloud customers.√¢¬Ä¬çExplore pricingSee us in action.Want to know how Assembled can help your team rise to the occasion?

Fast forward more than a century and this seasoned company has radically transformed itself, focusing solely on creating the best performance running gear and experiences, and embracing an omnichannel strategy to meet runners wherever they shop. Today, brooksrunning.com not only serves as the brand's direct-to-consumer heartbeat, but also facilitates seamless omnichannel shopping experiences, connecting customers to the best running retailers in the world.As the digital expansion of Brooks accelerated, the customer experience team confronted a formidable challenge √¢¬Ä¬î the need for efficient customer experience operations across multiple channels, hampered by disjointed systems and a lack of overall visibility.This is where Andrew Marston steps into the picture. Once a specialist, he rose to become a Runner Experience Supervisor. Recognizing the need for a robust workforce management (WFM) tool to sustain service levels and enhance efficiency, the team set out to evaluate vendors.A variety of WFM solutions were put under the microscope, but it was Assembled that emerged victorious. Its intuitive interface, live dashboard, and potent optimization features were the deciding factors. Andrew and his team were quick to grasp the value that Assembled brought to their customer experience operations.Assembled enabled team leaders to make in-the-moment modifications such as tailoring focus hours for specific channels and keeping a close eye on agent adherence in real time. This led to the inception of WFM Fridays, a day dedicated to fine-tuning break scheduling √¢¬Ä¬î made possible through Assembled's sophisticated optimization tools.The introduction of Assembled has been nothing short of transformative for Brooks.We saw a dramatic drop in our average phone wait time in the first three months of 2022, from 1 minute and 6 seconds to just 22 seconds, after implementing Assembled and expanding our team by two.√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬çAndrew Marston Runner Experience Supervisor, Brooks RunningThe forecasting tools and arrival pattern insights provided by Assembled have been crucial for understanding business trends, fostering data-driven decisions, and ensuring service levels are kept in check.But it's not all about efficiency.

As part of this process, the limited functionality of their existing chatbot was identified as an area where improvement should be made. With a clear understanding that today‚Äôs AI functionality is only poised to grow, Ulrich set out to evaluate, select, and deploy the best way to turn website visits into qualified leads and greater revenue.ChallengeWith an expected 333.5 million ecommerce shoppers by 2029, timely and relevant engagement with site visitors is increasingly critical to capturing more business growth. Like many companies, however, it was unsustainable for family-owned Ulrich to have staff available 24x7 to chat with online visitors in real time. In addition, when their sales team picked up a chat during business hours, they were finding that these prospects did not necessarily have a high level of product knowledge or purchase intent ‚Äî an inefficient use of the team‚Äôs time.Leads slipping through engagement cracksTraditional decision-tree chatbots ‚Äî like the version Ulrich was using from another provider ‚Äî have some serious limitations, especially for marketing and sales. For Ulrich, the strategy with their existing chatbot was to ‚Äúhope that someone was available‚Äù if a site visit was during business hours. Outside of working hours or if no one was free to take the conversation, the only option was to ask for an email address. With many visitors choosing not to submit their contact information at that point, it was clear to Roland Brickey, the company‚Äôs Director of Marketing Operations, that Ulrich was losing potential customers. ‚ÄúIt (the chat bot) was a little pop-up thing that most people would just minimize right away and go about their browsing,‚Äù recalls Brickey. ‚Äú We wouldn‚Äôt get any engagements at all ‚Äî it got to the point where (our) people thought we turned off our chat because there were no chats coming in.‚ÄùSolutionHaving decided that Ulrich clearly needed a ‚Äúbetter tool,‚Äù Brickey started searching for the right chatbot option to enhance the company‚Äôs rebuilt website. That‚Äôs when he discovered AI Bionic Chatbots from Drift. Unlike typical (and often frustrating-to-engage-with) chatbots that rely on fixed responses and decision trees, Bionic Chatbots let prospects lead the conversation, seamlessly shifting between topics as needed. By utilizing content you have uploaded to create fast, highly relevant AI-generated responses, a Bionic Chatbot lets you use AI to easily and efficiently offer the next best action for visitors ‚Äî tailored to their identity, journey stage, and past interactions. The Bionic Chatbot also monitors intent in real time to navigate users towards meetings, support, or content effectively. If sales intent or support intent is detected, the bot exits its AI Response node and continues the conversation as designed. The Bionic Chatbot can use different playbooks based on where your site visitor is coming from, be it an email, an ad, or organic search.An ‚Äúeasy, straightforward‚Äù deploymentAt Ulrich, the Bionics Chatbot was rolled out to four different lines of business teams. In addition to sheds, cabins, and garages, the chatbot was also extended to the horse barns unit. According to Brickey, ‚ÄúThe process was fairly straightforward, nothing super-complicated . . . I feel like it was a good experience. And it‚Äôs so nice to have the confidence now that a customer will get a response ‚Äî no matter the time or bandwidth.‚ÄùHaving led a successful deployment of the Bionics Chatbot, Brickey also offers these practical tips for others who are thinking about making the move themselves:Hitting the ground running will drive visible value more quicklyKeep feeding the chatbot good informationLet it do its thing as early as possibleThere‚Äôs so much functionality ‚Äî continue to build out your deploymentChoose your own adventureWhen engaging with a site visitor, the Bionic Chatbot acts as the digital experience‚Äôs ultimate traffic cop, using conversational cues and questions to direct visitors to the most appropriate resource or destination as quickly as possible. For visitors doing pre-purchase research, that may be the site‚Äôs customer service page, products page, or helpful content like articles and blog posts that Ulrich has uploaded. If there is information on our website that is helpful, the bot will throw that in there,‚Äù explains Brickey. ‚ÄúThere have definitely been some great scenarios where a customer was well informed who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have been.Roland Brickey Director of Marketing Operations at UlrichBut engaging and educating prospects without tying up sales reps is just the first step. When the bot determines through its interactions that a lead is ready to speak with sales, it will connect the visitor with a relevant Ulrich team member to continue the conversation. Having pre-qualified leads on the line has been a huge positive for Ulrich sales team members. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs boosting our salespeople's confidence,‚Äù relays Brickey, ‚Äúbecause they know they have a live person on the chat. They just get to it a lot quicker.‚ÄùResultsUlrich is definitely reaping the benefits of more efficient engagement with their move to a Bionic Chatbot. As Brickey explains, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bridging that gap between us trying to call or email at the ‚Äòright time‚Äô as opposed to knowing they‚Äôre live on the site, ready to talk.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what that looks like in terms of business impact:Meetings booked ‚Äì 35% improvementDeal cycle time on our sheds has improved by 30% for online leadsConversions from chat up 84%Average ticket increase of 15% What‚Äôs particularly remarkable is that these notable results have been achieved despite the fact that Brickey‚Äôs team hasn‚Äôt yet had the opportunity to fully leverage everything the tool has to offer. ‚ÄúWe have a few playbooks in place for general meetings bookings,‚Äù he reveals. ‚ÄúI wish we were doing more, but we haven‚Äôt had time to build out things like the paid ad playbooks and stuff like that.‚Äù The Ulrich website proudly informs visitors that, ‚ÄúWe are a high-energy, driven bunch with a big audacious goal to serve 1,000,000 families by 2028!‚Äù By adding the sophisticated yet straightforward power of the Bionic Chatbot to their online prospect and customer experiences, that goal doesn‚Äôt feel quite so audacious anymore.About Ulrich:The Ulrich family of companies is the premier solution for your backyard and lifestyle structure needs.

Their Capital on Tap Business Credit Card provides financial flexibility and supercharges small businesses with accessible capital, higher credit limits, and tailored rewards. In 2021, they expanded to the US, offering their innovative business credit card to American small business owners. Their customer support center is based in Cardiff, Wales and provides round-the-clock support to thousands of customers worldwide.Jon Bartlett, Head of Global Operations, is responsible for ensuring an exceptional experience for all of Capital On Tap√¢¬Ä¬ôs customers across all channels and business segments. His team aims to provide world-class service by connecting customers with agents who fully understand and empathize with them while achieving a service level of 95% of calls answered within 15 seconds. Maintaining this quality is challenging, and after trying various solutions, including outsourcing, Jon realized the best approach was to retain full ownership of every customer interaction through the Cardiff office.In 2021, Capital on Tap faced a roadblock in delivering flexible, responsive service: their schedule was managed using spreadsheets. Megan Collier, who led a team of agents at the time, recalls the experience:Our spreadsheet schedule had most agents on calls, one person on chat, and two on tickets every day. When call volumes spiked, we√¢¬Ä¬ôd scramble to shift someone from chat or tickets to calls. It was reactive and couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt scale.Megan Collier, Capacity Planning ManagerScale was crucial as Capital on Tap√¢¬Ä¬ôs business grew. The daily emergencies caused by unexpected spikes in customer demand were draining the team, and customer wait times were creeping up to almost a minute √¢¬Ä¬î far from the 15-second goal. They needed to find a solution to predict customer behavior, monitor real-time activity, and adjust confidently. They partnered with Assembled to implement a workforce management (WFM) solution that provided seamless real-time data and an intuitive interface for scheduling and forecasting.With Assembled, Megan Collier, promoted to Capacity Planning Manager, embraced Capital on Tap√¢¬Ä¬ôs company value √¢¬Ä¬úWhy Not Today√¢¬Ä¬ù and jumped on the opportunity to enhance their WFM function. The Assembled team collaborated with Megan to validate data, provide training, and gather feedback. After three meetings, including an on-site meeting in Cardiff, Capital on Tap was fully operational.Today, Megan√¢¬Ä¬ôs team uses Assembled to effectively predict customer behavior and create schedules that align with the business√¢¬Ä¬ôs rhythm. √¢¬Ä¬úAssembled is just very easy to use, and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs no second guessing what√¢¬Ä¬ôs going to happen when someone on my team uses it,√¢¬Ä¬ù she explains. Her team of three real-time analysts monitors agent activity across business lines, reducing emergencies and allowing for smooth schedule adjustments. Capital on Tap now meets their 95/15 SLA, achieves an average chat response time under 10 seconds, and operates without an interactive voice response system.The forecasting capabilities in Assembled allow us to accurately schedule all our agents across multiple skills to serve product types in the UK and the US.

Their app offers a two-sided global marketplace to connect members with gyms, spas, and other service providers to find the perfect match for their lifestyle. Classpass now contributes to the well-being of members across 30 countries.At the heart of ensuring that these members are having the inspiring, nurturing experiences they deserve is the Classpass support function. As Classpass has expanded their offerings and their global reach, the support function has evolved to keep pace. Ensuring that the right agent is ready with the right answer for both members and marketplace providers has only gotten more complex over time.Volume + complexity = spreadsheet painIn late 2022, the support team was feeling the pressure. Following the pandemic, the volume of contacts coming into Classpass agents increased significantly. The team√¢¬Ä¬ôs workforce manager was scheduling agents using spreadsheets, and the process just wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt scaling. It was challenging to adjust schedules and create forecasts due to the peaks and valleys of customer inquiries.We were looking to maximize our chat channel and it became really difficult to determine how many people we needed on an hourly basis. It's really hard to schedule to peaks when you don't even know what those peaks might look like."" Sarah Vanden Broek Senior Program Manager, Customer ExperiencePlus, there was no visibility into whether agents were doing the right work at the right time. This made adjusting schedules throughout the day nearly impossible. As a result, measuring adherence became a focus for the team.Assembled: the digital native solutionLeadership needed a way to quickly see and understand agent adherence across the CX function so they could better respond to the peaks of incoming contacts. They needed a workforce management tool that integrated seamlessly with their existing tech stack. The team had used legacy workforce management applications, but recognized that these solutions just weren√¢¬Ä¬ôt built for the way they delivered support via chat and email. Classpass needed a better way to do WFM, a way that was as agile as they were, and as accurate as possible.We were really looking for a workforce management platform that was a digital native, and an implementation partner who could support our move to Zendesk Messaging."" Sarah Vanden Broek Senior Program Manager, Customer ExperienceClasspass needed to ensure complete data accuracy in their workforce management tool. The Assembled team jumped in to fully validate that data was flowing accurately and that forecasting and reporting were accurate. During this period, Classpass and Assembled met bi-weekly to invest the time into getting everything on the right track.The Assembled team made implementation really easy. The schedule made it very clear to see who owned what tasks. We never felt like we had to lead our own implementation and I think that's so different from other vendors. It was nice to understand the things that we needed to do to go live. And ongoing support has been great√¢¬Ä¬îBhargavi is one of the best customer success managers we√¢¬Ä¬ôve worked with!√¢¬Ä¬ù Sarah Vanden Broek Senior Program Manager, Customer ExperienceVisibility into adherence removes the √¢¬Ä¬úscary√¢¬Ä¬ù from staffingManagers in the core CX team, which helps resolve issues and add value for Classpass membership subscribers, used Assembled to gain a transparent understanding of what agents were doing, when. This resulted in the ability to take the steps they needed to increase adherence and drive down costs. The team has increased org-wide adherence by a whopping 12%. Plus, scheduling and forecasting in Assembled was so easy that the team was able to maintain their workforce manager headcount even as the volume and complexity of customer interactions grew.Assembled has improved our ability to predict what could happen. We're using the platform to determine our future forecasting and our headcount in a way that is much more data-informed. We just have more data, and that makes any decision we make a lot less scary."" Sarah Vanden Broek Senior Program Manager, Customer ExperienceThe CX team√¢¬Ä¬ôs success was so dramatic that the Partner team, which serves high-touch service providers, took notice and brought on Assembled to help transform their support operations.I√¢¬Ä¬ôll have data I just couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt get elsewhere. The thing I√¢¬Ä¬ôm most interested in is visibility into chat adherence, since it√¢¬Ä¬ôs the preferred channel for our partners. Assembled is absolutely going to change the way I work with my teams."" Jaco Barnard, Manager Program ManagementToday, Assembled supports both the CX team as well as the Partner team in ensuring support agents are there wherever clients need them. They√¢¬Ä¬ôve improved forecasting, created visibility into adherence, and achieved time and cost savings along the way.

The team sets out to work towards ‚Äúa government for the people, by the people, that works in the digital age.‚ÄùAbove all else, the Code for America team believes in showing up with empathy for their clients, which is why they use Intercom‚Äôs Conversational Support solution to provide help at every stage of the application process. ‚ÄúWe believe that government at all levels can and should work well for all people. Using insights and ideas from real people, we break down barriers to meet community needs and improve government in meaningful ways,‚Äù says Arlene Corbin Lewis, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer at Code for America.To do this, the team partners closely with local government to give people better access to public programs. They have developed a broad range of initiatives, including GetCalFresh and MNbenefits, to help people apply for a variety of benefits in the states of California and Minnesota. 2Helping to put food on the tableIn California, GetCalFresh assists residents with applying to CalFresh, the state‚Äôs version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Through CalFresh, residents get monthly benefits that they can use to buy food for their household. Since 2019, GetCalFresh has helped more than six million people either access or maintain their SNAP benefits. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, the Code for America team saw a weekly average of 3,000 conversations coming through the Intercom Messenger. Over the past 12 months, they‚Äôve had to scale their efforts to support the 9,000 conversations they were receiving every week at the height of the pandemic ‚Äì a 300% increase. Thanks to Intercom‚Äôs Inbox and bots, the team has been able to continue providing highly personal support despite the massive surge in conversation volume, using Resolution Bot to offer instant self-serve support and answer frequently asked questions through English, Spanish, and Cantonese. This lets the team maintain a fast response time for more urgent queries that need immediate attention from someone on the team.3Striking the balance between efficient and personal supportAt the same time, the team strives to balance efficient support and personal interaction. For instance, people often reach out to ask for their case number or get an update on their application. The team can quickly look up the information and provide updates through Intercom in a matter of seconds, saving people hours of time and enabling them to move on to the next stage of the process. ‚ÄúKnowing that there‚Äôs someone with you and on your side when you‚Äôre facing tough times can have such an impact.‚ÄùArlene Corbin LewisChief Communications and Marketing Officer at Code for AmericaThey also take the time to say something as simple as ‚ÄúI can see that your case is pending,‚Äù just to reassure clients that there is a person on the other side of the conversation ready to support them. ‚ÄúKnowing that there‚Äôs someone with you and on your side when you‚Äôre facing tough times can have such an impact,‚Äù says Arlene. 4Fueling change through feedbackAs the team discovered during the COVID-19 crisis, confusion around claiming benefits is a huge issue for people. This is driven largely by the fact that in certain states, government benefits are administered on a county-by-county basis, rather than at the state level, which makes finding the relevant resources and documentation a convoluted process. ‚ÄúBy removing barriers like multiple phone calls, visits to the county office, or waiting in long lines to fill out paper applications, we‚Äôre meeting people‚Äôs needs at a deeper level of dignity and respect.‚Äù Intercom enables the Code for America team to analyze client conversations and feed valuable insights back to the California Department of Social Services, which has oversight of CalFresh, so they can help move the needle on improving access to government benefits. ‚ÄúThese feedback loops are helping to make more equitable outcomes possible,‚Äù explains Arlene. ‚ÄúAnd by removing barriers like multiple phone calls, visits to the county office, or waiting in long lines to fill out paper applications, we‚Äôre meeting people‚Äôs needs at a deeper level of dignity and respect.‚Äù 5Bridging the digital divideAnother initiative that the Code for America team has developed is MNbenefits, which assists Minnesotans with getting access to a number of the state‚Äôs public programs. The team has partnered closely with local government in Minnesota to improve the application process for nine different safety net benefits, including food assistance, cash programs, emergency assistance, housing support, and child care assistance. ‚ÄúOur Integrated Benefits team has been working with the state of Minnesota to build a new integrated public benefits application. Now, clients from several counties across the state can apply for multiple programs, all from one mobile-friendly website.‚ÄùDeirdre HirschtrittSenior Qualitative Researcher at Code for AmericaDeirdre Hirschtritt, a Senior Qualitative Researcher at Code for America who works on the MNbenefits program, explains that the team uses Intercom to offer personal support to their clients as they‚Äôre guided through the application process. Before the introduction of MNbenefits, applying to the state‚Äôs benefit programs took over an hour. Now, thanks to the initiative, the application process has been reduced to just 12 minutes and the team has helped to process applications for 25,000 people. ‚ÄúOver the past year, our Integrated Benefits team has been working with the state of Minnesota to build a new integrated public benefits application,‚Äù Deirdre says. ‚ÄúNow, clients from several counties across the state can apply for multiple programs, all from one mobile-friendly website.‚Äù 6Offering continued support Speaking to the impact Intercom has had on the team‚Äôs ability to support their clients, Deirdre says, ‚ÄúIntercom enables us to help our clients navigate the application process for benefits, to answer questions they might have, and then offer them support after they‚Äôve completed the application. When people come back to our site, Intercom is their first point of contact to get in touch with us about their case status or how to take the next step in the enrollment process.‚Äù This conversational approach to communicating with their clients is one of the main reasons the Code for America team chose Intercom to power their support. Through conversations, the team is able to learn more about their clients in order to adapt to help people in different situations. As Deirdre explains, ‚ÄúA staff member from a community-based organization recently got in touch with us through Intercom to ask for support for one of her clients. She asked about how to apply for a family in a specific situation ‚Äì which our application didn‚Äôt yet support ‚Äì and we were able to guide her client through the application process and then work with our product team to create the functionality to support families in similar situations in the future.‚Äù The ability to have conversations through the Intercom Messenger has also created opportunities for the MNbenefits team to connect with local organizations and expand their program to support more people. ‚ÄúAs a result of the conversational tone of our communication through chat, the staff member from the community-based organization and I learned more about each other‚Äôs work and made a plan to meet over Zoom to continue the conversation about how our team can better support her clients in the future,‚Äù Deirdre says. 7Keeping clients connected Similar to the GetCalFresh program, Deirdre explains that the feedback loop Intercom enables between MNbenefits‚Äô clients and their caseworkers is incredibly important to their team. ‚ÄúI think the most meaningful use of Intercom that we‚Äôve had to date is the quick feedback loop it allows between clients who need help getting food on the table and caseworkers who can help process those applications. Just today we got a message from a client who had applied for SNAP months ago and hadn‚Äôt heard anything back about his eligibility. I was able to immediately contact his county and within the hour, a staff member had called the client to get him his benefits right then and there.‚Äù8Making a differenceThe important work that Code for America is doing across all of their programs continues to impact the lives of millions of people, working endlessly to bridge the digital divide between government benefits and assistance programs and the people who need them most.‚ÄúMy colleague described Intercom as a sort of ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô in itself. In a bureaucratic system where hour-long waits on phone lines are the norm, Intercom is a way for clients to connect with a human in real time.‚Äù Speaking to the role Intercom plays in helping the team to continue this work, Deirdre says, ‚ÄúOur work falls into what‚Äôs called the social safety net ‚Äì programs like SNAP and Medicaid are a way that we catch people who are struggling and offer some support. My colleague described Intercom as a sort of ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô in itself. In a bureaucratic system where hour-long waits on phone lines are the norm, Intercom is a way for clients to connect with a human in real time.‚Äù Related customer storiesLiving SpacesHaving traditionally fostered a culture of building in-person relationships with customers, the Living Spaces team wanted to find a way to replicate that online.

Schedule a meeting with us to address your specific needs Speak With An Expert ‚úï ___ Case Study Consumer Electronics Retailer Boosts CSAT 28 Points With AI Chatbot v Vanden Borre is a leading Belgian retailer in the Fnac-Darty group for consumer electronics and household appliances. Since 2021, iAdvize has been helping the brand enhance their e-commerce conversational strategy. To take their user experience up a notch, they decided to integrate iAdvize's multilingual generative AI across all 15,000 of their product pages, offering 24/7 assistance to visitors throughout their online buying journey. v CHALLENGES Offer High-Quality Shopping Assistance to E-Commerce Site Visitors 24/7 For Vanden Borre, every sale is a contract of trust with the customer‚Äîpeople are at the heart of their mission. More specifically, the brand prioritizes improving the daily lives of their teams and enriching the customer experience. With the introduction of iAdvize's Trusted Generative AI for E-commerce, the brand immediately recognized the vast potential of this technological innovation to meet its business goals. ü§ù Automate the handling of technical product questions with ultra-detailed answers in natural language, while prioritizing human support for more complex inquiries. ü§ñ Incorporate this new technology into their existing automation strategy to determine business impact on CSAT and ROI compared to their previous-generation NLU chatbot. üáßüá™ Provide accurate, reliable responses across multiple languages to cater to their French and Dutch customers. ‚Äù Our goal throughout this trial was‚Äîwithin a strict framework of protecting our data and that of our customers‚Äîto assess how generative AI could provide more qualitative responses in multiple languages than our current NLU solution, while keeping our advisors at the heart of the system. Cyrille Regardin Director of Aftersales & Contact Center at Vanden Borre v Solutions Provide Seamless Assistance to Consumers in Their Preferred Language With a Generative AI Chatbot Vanden Borre chose to integrate our iAdvize Copilot‚Ñ¢ for Shoppers, a chatbot powered by generative AI technology that autonomously understands and responds to site visitors in any natural language. Complementing the brand's existing connected bot that offers a store locator and order tracking information, iAdvize Copilot‚Ñ¢ sees excellent pre-sales performance. It helps scale guidance for consumers throughout their e-commerce customer journey with unprecedented accuracy and response quality, maximizing conversion potential while freeing up human respondents to handle more complex requests. 1 üî∞ Ensured Data Security A top priority for the brand is safeguarding the confidentiality of consumer data. We began by establishing essential security protocols; Linking the AI to Vanden Borre's product listings and guaranteeing dependable technology devoid of errors. We also defined scenarios where the AI should either pass the conversation to a human or refrain from responding, in accordance with the brand's internal guidelines. 2 üß™ An Experimental Phase Before deploying the AI chatbot across all product pages, Vanden Borre tested it with their catalog of major household appliances‚Äîitems that frequently prompt technical questions. The pilot yielded the anticipated results, leading to a gradual expansion of the chatbot's use. The generative AI is natively multilingual. Once equipped with Vanden Borre's data, it functions autonomously, translating information seamlessly without any need for the brand or the user to make adjustments. 3 üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Committed Human Support The human touch is a key component in the success of the generative AI. With in-depth product details and the persistent dedication of the Vanden Borre teams, the bot was able to achieve significant advancements in a remarkably short time and without any formal training. Within just a month of testing, iAdvize teams were able to pinpoint both strengths and areas in need of refinement, ensuring all visitors consistently receive thorough and accurate responses to their questions. v Results An AI Customer Solution That Boosts Satisfaction and Reduces Volume to Frontline Agents Results proved that iAdvize‚Äôs generative AI-powered chatbot greatly outperformed Vanden Borre‚Äôs previous NLU bot. This revelation enabled the brand to combine both AIs into a comprehensive pre-sales support strategy. Their existing NLU chatbot guides visitors for common requests, like store location and order tracking, while iAdvize Copilot‚Ñ¢ for Shoppers answers all other questions and transfers to a human respondent to assist with more complex inquiries. üòç Customer Satisfaction 80% CSAT score +28 points vs. previous-generation AI bots (NLU) ü™Ñ Automation Rate 58% of conversations fully automated by our Copilot‚Ñ¢ for Shoppers üõçÔ∏è Conversion Rate 2x CVR vs. previous-generation AI bots (NLU) ‚Äù After a few months, we‚Äôre pleased to confirm that this pre-sales solution offers real added value to our customers and integrates smoothly into our customer journey. We‚Äôve observed significant differences in interactions between our Dutch-speaking and French-speaking clients and the AI, which is particularly interesting for better understanding their specific support needs. Thanks to a high-quality and controlled experience, we can now move on to considering the next stages of deployment with iAdvize.

Collecting order information through phone and email and sending it to the drop-shipper was tedious and could take 10-20 minutes each time. Additionally, orders could only be processed when Mayr was available. Otherwise, the orders would be shipped once he had time to submit them. However, since 95% of his customers were on Facebook, Mayr decided to explore chatbots to streamline the process. From tedious to effortless: bot saves time and increases efficiency COMPANY The company sells high-quality and innovative photo booth systems for events and earns revenue by supplying specialized ink and paper to past customers across Europe. INDUSTRY eCommerce COUNTRY Germany Challenge: the process of placing and taking orders becomes tough Since placing and taking orders became time and effort-consuming, J√ºrgen Mayr aimed to enable customers to order supply materials without his physical presence. That way, Photobooth Deluxe's founder and CEO wanted to simplify and fasten the process for both customers and the business. Goal: implement a code-free solution to process orders without human touch With the Messenger bot built in Chatfuel, Mayr has automated over $100,000 in revenue. And he‚Äôs already asked his invoicing company to consider adding an API for their service to automate the final sales step.Photobooth Deluxe experienced a surge in sales because the automated ordering process is so simple. Normally, consumers shop around to check prices with different vendors before ordering supplies. But a straightforward and automated process makes it more comfortable for them to reorder, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if a certain item is a few euros more expensive. Customers now order anyway because the quality and ease of service are more important to them than getting the lowest price. Results: $100K+ in revenue automated, quality of service and sales improved FEATURES USED User attributes Photobooth Deluxe used them to track each customer's spending and populate the total amount, which updates automatically with each new order Notify admin plugin Each time a customer orders through the chatbot, it instantly emails Mayr and the drop-shipper, so they can package and ship the order right away Sponsored messages After a customer places an order, Mayr‚Äôs bot offers them a supply check-in notification in 30 days in case they need to reorder supplies JSON API plugin Mayr used it to integrate Twilio and send automated SMS to the drop-shipping company to look out for a new-order email Zapier integration The automatically sends customers a tracking number, so they can monitor their shipment 'The goal was to enable my customers to order supply materials without my physical presence. When I come back home, all I have to do is write the invoices.' ‚Äî J√ºrgen Mayr, founder and CEO of Photobooth Deluxe Get started FREE Photobooth Deluxe tracks customer spending using Chatfuel's attribute feature. By keeping a record of total expenditure, the company can create custom and lookalike audiences for targeted sponsored messages and Facebook ads. It helps grow the business and showcases how technology can enhance customer experiences. Few features make Messenger chatbot super-effective User attributes Notify admin via email plugin Whenever a customer orders through a chatbot, it instantly sends emails to Photobooth Deluxe and the drop-shipper for speedy processing. Sponsored messages After a customer places an order, the bot asks if they‚Äôd like to receive a supply check-in notification in 30 days. Photobooth Deluxe‚Äôs customers often forget to stock up on supplies otherwise, so these reminders are helpful for them and bring in more revenue for the company. Integrations Using third-party and JSON APIs, Photobooth Deluxe can connect Chatfuel to other platforms like Twilio or Zapier for an extra way of informing customers and the drop-shipper. Some new-order emails can get missed or end up in spam folders. Instead, the bot automatically sends an SMS to the drop-shipping company to look out for a new-order email and sends customers messages with a tracking number so they can keep tabs on their shipment. Running a business can be tough, especially when resources are limited.

Chatbot grants temporary and immediate assistance to customers COMPANY Argomall is a top electronics retail website that sells authentic consumer electronics. The company has a catalog of 3,000 products, including TVs, smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Its broad customer base caters to anybody willing to buy devices online. INDUSTRY eCommerce Challenge: the brand's Facebook overflows with customer requests While prioritizing personalized convenience, the main objective was not to replace the customer service team but to provide temporary yet immediate assistance to customers.Additionally, Argomall aimed to capitalize on the increased traffic to their Facebook Page and make it easier and more appealing for visitors to become customers. Goal: interact with customers in real time and at scale The chatbot makes it easier than ever for Argomall‚Äôs prospects to convert to customers, and the metrics reflect this:Product sales increased by 10% from their Messenger bot conversations.Since Argomall launched the Messenger chatbot, which gives instant answers to FAQs, customers have received even faster service. The support agents are no longer tied up replying to the same routine inquiries repeatedly. Instead, they provide focused, timely customer support with more advanced queries.Argomall experienced a 23x increase in ROI in the first few months after launching its chatbot, which is unparalleled compared to the other tools it uses.The brand now grows 40% yearly and looks forward to continuing that trajectory with conversational commerce. Results: +10% sales, 23x ROI, +40% yearly brand growth FEATURES USED Google site search This plugin is activated by user input and instantly returns results to the user in Messenger, making product discovery easier. It suggests items in a category or provides specs and availability in seconds, all without leaving the app. Save user input This plugin allows the Argomall chatbot to capture customer data (e.g., shipping address) and save it as a user attribute. Once Argomall is ready to fulfill and send out the order, it takes this info from Chatfuel for a smooth and streamlined process. Live chat Argomall's human support agents use it to interact with customers anytime without the chatbot interrupting their conversation. The retail live chat allows prospects and customers to resolve their questions with a human agent at the click of a button. COUNTRY Philippines Get started FREE‚ÄòWe have seen an immediate growth in revenue from our Chatfuel bot.‚Äô ‚Äî Karel Holub, Argomall‚Äôs Chief Argonaut Once the Argomall team noticed increasing activity on their Facebook Page, they designed the automation with three main functions: How Argomall used Chatfuel Argomall‚Äôs chatbot answers generic questions about product availability, pricing, etc., allowing customer service representatives to spend their time on more complex issues instead. Answering FAQs The second purpose of the chatbot is to guide customers through their online shopping journey at Argomall: greet them, provide product info, and answer questions. As a result, buyers receive a customized shopping experience they wouldn‚Äôt get if they were simply browsing the Argomall website on their own. Guiding users through the shopping process Argomall‚Äôs chatbot streamlines sales by allowing users to place orders without leaving Messenger. This is a crucial feature for the online electronics store based in the Philippines because Facebook is free to use, whereas browsing an eCommerce storefront there is not. Argomall uses a COD (cash on delivery) system, so the chatbot needs to collect order and shipping info and provide a delivery estimate and an invoice. Allowing users to place orders within Messenger Any tool that improves the sales process is valuable to the market.Chatfuel developed an innovative tool for this purpose: Fuely AI agent.Maximize the potential of automation across multiple platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and your website.Join Chatfuel ‚Äî it's time to transform how you conduct business.

This case study explores how an e-commerce powerhouse specializing in performance apparel that focuses on creating comfortable and versatile activewear for activities like fitness, yoga, running, and outdoor pursuits partnered with Level AI to improve its contact center operations.Navigating Pain Points:The e-commerce enterprise grappled with substantial spikes in call volume, occasionally necessitating phone line shutdowns to manage the surge effectively. These spikes were exacerbated by a recent transition to a new ERP, Dynamics 365, bringing forth a cascade of changes in the backend infrastructure.Faced with high agent turnover, lengthy onboarding, and minimal coaching, the contact center team struggled to deliver exceptional customer service. Determined to turn things around, the company set out to improve agent performance and customer satisfaction through three key initiatives: analyzing customer interactions systematically, establishing clear performance metrics for agents, and developing personalized coaching programs targeting specific areas for improvement. However, supervisors soon found themselves buried under mountains of daily tasks, leaving minimal time to craft effective performance scorecards and coaching plans. Even for the few conversations they managed to analyze, identifying key topics for targeted improvement proved challenging.To make matters worse, a fractured view of customer data across various platforms ‚Äì-CCaaS, CSAT, AI Analytics & CRM‚Äìburied the voice of the customer, which left supervisors struggling to make improvements.Objectives:The company sought a solution to automate and enhance QA processes, create agent performance scorecards, and derive valuable insights from customer interactions. The ultimate objective was to boost agent efficiency by speeding up response times, identifying productivity bottlenecks, and, therefore, providing a better customer experience.Additionally, the company was looking for a solution that could provide detailed insights into customer sentiments, including empathy, language usage, and other key sentiments. These insights will not only assist supervisors in identifying coaching opportunities but also hold the potential to significantly enhance agent performance.Level AI-Driven Growth:Level AI became a crucial ally for this e-commerce company by identifying and tagging important conversations for analysis. This includes instances where agents received low scores and situations where customer satisfaction is at risk. In addition, the tool offers valuable context to conversations, scores every interaction (including calls, emails, and chats), and provides automation in manual tasks like auto-summaries and auto-dispositions to boost their customer support efforts.By harnessing the power of Level AI‚Äôs Agent Assist, the agents can easily address difficult customer queries without having to memorize the company knowledge base, thereby substantially reducing agent onboarding and training time.In addition, the e-commerce company leverages Level AI‚Äôs out-of-the-box dashboards to gain comprehensive insights into customer satisfaction. In Level AI, they introduced a conversation tag that flags instances when a customer encounters a technical issue. Consequently, they have now set up a dashboard to compare Net Promoter Scores (NPS) specifically when these ‚Äútechnical issues‚Äù tags are activated. This allows managers to pinpoint how platform problems directly affect customer satisfaction, hence facilitating platform updates, ultimately leading to improved customer experiences.The company expresses genuine appreciation for the depth of insights provided by Level AI, which goes beyond simple analytics. The software‚Äôs ability to categorize and understand the voice of the customer stands out, empowering the team with valuable information for informed decision-making and proactive customer support strategies.Conclusion:This case study exemplifies the transformative potential of Level AI in reshaping customer support operations for an e-commerce giant. From automating QA processes and generating detailed scorecards to unlocking valuable insights and providing real-time assistance, Level AI emerges as a strategic partner in the company‚Äôs journey toward operational excellence. The collaboration holds the promise of not just resolving current challenges but also setting the stage for a more efficient, insightful, and customer-centric approach to customer support.Read more customer storiesView allCase StudyAn Online Retailer‚Äôs Journey to Improved Customer Experience: Choosing Level AI for Contact Center IntelligenceCase StudyUnlocking the Power of AI in Contact Center Operations: A Conversation with QuinStreetCase StudyGlobalfaces Unleashes Next Level AI to Revolutionize Global Charitable Fundraising4 min readView allCREATE A BRAND THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS LOVERequest DemoQuick LinksAboutCareersPartnersRequest DemoSecurityTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySitemapResourcesResource CenterEventsPressNext Level CommunityProductQuality AsssuranceAgent AssistVoice of the Customer InsightsAgent CoachingAgent Screen RecordingAnalyticsAgent GPTPlatformArtificial IntelligenceIntegrationsCompare toCallminerCrestaObserve AITethrPlayvoxMaestroQAUniphoresubscribe to the newsletterSubscribe and be the first to hear about news events.
